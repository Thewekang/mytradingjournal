# Project Status Report – Sep 2 2025

## Executive Summary
Planning formalized for Phase 3 execution covering: design system completion, export hardening (column selection delivered), streaming CSV, observability (structured logging + request IDs), performance pre-aggregation, advanced goals, offline capture, and i18n scaffold. Column selection UI and token hardening (expiry + one-time use) are now implemented. Next focus: streaming CSV + logging enrichment.

## Changes Since Sep 1
- Added column selection UI on exports page (checkbox multi-select + All/None shortcuts) feeding `selectedColumns` param (omitted when all selected).
- Builder already conditionally filters headers; no backend change required beyond param normalization.
- Token hardening affirmed: expiry + one-time consumption logic present in download route (`downloadTokenExpiresAt`, `downloadTokenConsumedAt`).
- Roadmap updated to reflect completed items & new status labels.
- Execution plan drafted (multi-sprint sequencing + micro-plan) – see `execution-plan.md`.

## Current Focus (Next 5 Days)
1. Streaming CSV implementation (introduce threshold constant, async generator, response flush path).
2. Structured logging enrichment (ensure request id from middleware flows into all handlers; add correlation to export worker logs).
3. Pre-aggregation schema draft (`DailyEquity`).
4. Add avg hold time + daily variance metrics (calculation & tests).
5. Contrast audit adjustments finalization (light theme states).

## Metrics & Quality (unchanged from Sep 1 unless noted)
- Tests: All passing (no new suites added today).
- Type Check: Clean.
- Lint: Clean.
- Export Job Security: Tokens expire (default 10m) and are single-use (post-download mark consumed) outside test env.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Streaming path memory misuse | High memory usage | Implement chunk size constant + backpressure via async generator |
| Pre-aggregation correctness drift | Wrong analytics | Build validation comparer & alert log |
| Light theme regressions | A11y issues | Contrast matrix script before large refactor |
| Goal expansion complexity | Timeline slip | Deliver metrics (avg hold, variance) before composite goals |
| Offline queue complexity | Delay | Scaffold minimal manifest + service worker first |

## Action Items
| # | Action | Status |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | Implement streaming CSV threshold constant | Pending |
| 2 | Add async generator & chunked response for trades export | Pending |
| 3 | Extend logger context to export worker loop | Pending |
| 4 | Draft and add `DailyEquity` model migration | Pending |
| 5 | Implement avg hold time + daily variance metrics + tests | Pending |

## Summary
Foundational planning captured; early export usability/security improvements shipped. Ready to begin performance and observability enhancements.

# Project Status Report – Sep 6 2025

## Executive Summary
Milestone 7 (Settings & Personalization) is COMPLETE and reflected consistently across docs. Experimental PDF print report is functional behind a flag. FX conversion is implemented behind a flag with DB-first lookup, in-memory cache, and previous-business-day fallback plus a guarded cron for backfills. Export subsystem now documents streaming CSV, soft memory guard, performance endpoint, and correlation. OpenAPI spec expanded to include new analytics exports, PDF endpoint, export jobs, equity validation, and cron routes.

Milestone 8 (Performance & QA): PARTIAL — e2e auth+trade scaffolding (Windows-skipped) in place; per-user TTL analytics cache with LRU cap + hit/miss/evict metrics exposed via /api/health; initial analytics edge-case unit tests added; DB indexes for tag/date filters applied; env-gated Sentry observability scaffold wired; full Sentry/OTEL instrumentation and accessibility sweep pending.

## Changes Since Sep 4
- Roadmap: fixed Milestone 7 section duplication; marked complete with follow-ups for advanced goals.
- Architecture: added appendices for FX raw-SQL exception and export instrumentation/correlation; updated footer.
- README: expanded export capabilities (streaming, perf endpoint) and added equity validation + cron endpoints list.
- OpenAPI: added routes for tag-performance export, daily export, PDF export, exports jobs (+perf, token refresh, download), equity validate/range, and cron endpoints (equity rebuild, perf prune, fx-backfill).
- AI Context: consolidated feature flags section and Windows dev caveat for DB-backed tests.
- Changelog: new 2025-09-06 entry summarizing PDF, FX, streaming exports, and equity validation.

## Current Focus (Next)
1. Performance metrics UI for export timings with pruning policy.
2. Automated equity rebuild scheduling and last-run surfacing.
3. Sentry/OTEL instrumentation across API and worker.
4. Advanced analytics (avg hold time, daily variance) and composite/per-instrument goals.

## Metrics & Quality
- Tests/Build: Documentation-only changes; build unaffected. Unit/integration tests remain as per last passing CI.
- Flags: ENABLE_EXPORTS=1 in CI; ENABLE_PDF_EXPORT and ENABLE_FX_CONVERSION remain opt-in.

## Risks & Notes
- Windows file-lock with Prisma engine: Prefer CI/WSL for DB-backed tests; use Prisma stubs with FOCUS_TEST=1 for targeted unit tests.

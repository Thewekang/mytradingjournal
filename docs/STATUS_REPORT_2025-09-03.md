# Project Status Report â€“ Sep 3 2025

## Executive Summary
Unified export feature flag (`ENABLE_EXPORTS`) fully adopted; legacy in-memory queue removed. Migration guidance published (CHANGELOG) and guard script prevents reintroduction of deprecated flags. Version bumped to `0.2.0`. CI workflow updated to enable exports and enforce guard. All tests (50 files / 75 tests) passing; build stable. Focus shifts to streaming CSV and logging enrichment next.

## Changes Since Sep 2
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` with migration note for export flag consolidation & removal of in-memory queue.
- Deleted stub `lib/export/queue.ts` after confirming zero imports.
- Introduced `scripts/guard-deprecated-flags.mjs` + `npm run guard:flags` script; integrated into CI.
- Bumped package version `0.1.0` -> `0.2.0` (minor due to removal + config change).
- Updated README with CHANGELOG link and guard instructions.
- CI: fixed env indentation, added guard step, set `ENABLE_EXPORTS=1` for build-test job.

## Current Focus (Next 5 Days)
1. Implement streaming CSV threshold + async generator path (memory-safe large exports).
2. Structured logging enrichment: propagate request/trace IDs into export worker & analytics routes.
3. Draft `DailyEquity` pre-aggregation schema migration (& validation test harness).
4. Add avg hold time & daily variance analytics with tests.
5. Evaluate token refresh UX (auto-regenerate on expired download attempt).

## Metrics & Quality
- Tests: 50 files / 75 tests passing.
- Build: Production build successful (Next.js 15.5.2).
- Lint / Types: Clean as per build.
- Export Security: Expiry + one-time token logic present (skipped only in test env); guard ensures deprecated flags absent.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Large export memory spike pre-streaming | High memory usage | Implement streaming threshold; benchmark before enabling by default |
| Logging context gaps (worker) | Harder debugging | Inject request/trace fallback & attach job id context |
| Pre-aggregation correctness drift | Analytics inaccuracies | Dual-run validation comparing raw vs aggregated for a window |
| Token expiry UX friction | User confusion | Graceful 410 + client auto requeue/regenerate flow |
| Guard script omission in PR forks | Missed regression | Add required status in future (optional) |

## Action Items
| # | Action | Status |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | Streaming CSV threshold constant | Pending |
| 2 | Async generator chunked export path | Pending |
| 3 | Extend logger context to worker | Pending |
| 4 | `DailyEquity` migration & tests | Pending |
| 5 | Avg hold time & variance analytics | Pending |
| 6 | Token refresh UX design | Pending |

## Summary
Migration completed cleanly with tooling (guard + changelog). Stable baseline ready for performance and observability improvements.
